# Getting Started

Hello,

Thanks for taking out the time to read about [bangle.io](https://bangle.io). Here is a short guide to get your started.

### Creating a workspace

Workspaces are collection of notes that you can open with Bangle.io. You can choose to have multiple workspaces or keep all your notes in one workspace.

:warning: _Don't forget to backup before opening your data. If you are in hurry simply copy and paste all your notes to another location to create a backup._

To start taking notes, let us first create a new Workspace.

Click on the Command Palette icon at top right.

> :keyboard: Command Palette can be triggered by pressing `Command-Shift-p` on mac, `Ctrl-Shift-P` on windows, `Command-O` mac Firefox,  `Ctrl-O` windows Firefox.

You can either search for a command or scroll through the list. We want to run the`New workspace` command as shown below:

Once executed select one of the following options:

- **Your computer**: This option allows bangle to open a directory in your computer, ideally have markdown notes. Note: It is currently only available in Chrome and Edge browsers.

- **Browser:** If you cannot use the above option you can save your notes in the browser storage. Though it has the drawback of not opening any of your existing notes.

:bulb:_We recommend that you store the notes in your computer to fully take advantage of all the features._

- Next you will be shown a directory picker.
- If you already have Markdown notes select that folder.
- Or create a new directory that Bangle will use to save your notes.

:bulb:_Pick a directory in a memorable location like Desktop, Documents etc._

### Creating a note

There are two ways to create a new note:

- **Using a command:** Execute the command `New note` from the command palette.

- **Inline backlink:** In an existing note create a backlink to a new note by typing`[[` followed by the name of your note you wish to create.

### Using inline palette

You can type `/` anywhere in your document or press `Command-/` (mac) `Ctrl-/` (win) to bring a handy toolbar for inserting things.

### Formatting text

Bangle uses the following markdown shortcuts to format text:

- **bold** `Cmd+B`

- _italic_ `Cmd+I`

- For link `Cmd+K `or select text and paste link on it.

- \~~~strikethrough~~\~

- For image drag or paste it directly.

- ```` ``` ````for code block

- `` `inline code` ``

- `*` followed by space for bullet point or `Cmd-shift-8`

- `1.` follow by space for numbered list or `Cmd-shift-9`

- `[ ]` followed by space for todo list or `Cmd-shift-7`

You can also select text to bring up a floating menu to making formatting changes.
