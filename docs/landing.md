### _A local note taking app for the rest of us_ üê•

---

Hello,

Thanks for taking out the time to read about [bangle.io](https://bangle.io). I know it is an _insanely_ crowded market and every day a new note taking app pops up. Yet here I am, passionately working on this project for the past 3 years hoping people will like it.

_(_:bulb: _yes you can edit this page!)_

### 1. You own your notes

- **Local:** Modify notes right from your computer. Think Notion, but local only.

- **No data lock-in:** bangle stores your notes in a human readable **_Markdown_** format.

### 2. Not your usual note taking app

- **WYSIWYG**: Even though we save things in Markdown format, Bangle will enrich your eyes with rich text formatting.

- **Modern rich text editor:** Bangle uses its sister project [bangle.dev](https://github.com/bangle-io/bangle.dev) which unlocks us to build a powerful editor like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) or [Dropbox paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper) and support real time collaboration.

- **Extensibility:** Even though it's a web app it was built ground up to be extended by awesome extensions. (_We have bunch of community extensions coming out soon.)_

### 3. Portability at its core

- **No Electron:** :heart: for web and speed, thats it.

- **Performant:** Throw thousands of notes at it and Bangle will chug along fine. _(Try opening a heavy project like [10,000 Markdown Files](https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/10000-markdown-files).)_

### Why try it out?

The cost of trying it out is low as this is a web app, no installation is needed. Also, as mentioned above there is no data lock-in. You can open your existing Markdown notes try it out and still continue to use your favorite note taking app.

**Bangle.io is in its early stages**, so expect some important features missing and some stability issues. If you are already happy with your current setup, thats great, but if you think there is a potential here please help us spread the word, every bit counts :raising_hand_woman: !
