# Getting Started

### Creating a workspace

To start taking notes, let us first create a new Workspace.

Click on the Command Palette icon at top right.

> :keyboard: Command Palette can be triggered by pressing `Command-Shift-p` on mac, `Ctrl-Shift-P` on windows, `Command-O` mac Firefox,  `Ctrl-O` windows Firefox.

You can either search for a command or scroll through the list. We want to run the`New workspace` command as shown below:

Once executed select one of the following options:

- **Your computer**: This option allows bangle to open a directory in your computer, ideally have markdown notes. Note: It is currently only available in Chrome and Edge browsers.

- **Browser:** If you cannot use the above option you can save your notes in the browser storage. Though it has the drawback of not opening any of your existing notes.

:bulb:_We recommend that you store the notes in your computer to fully take advantage of all the features._

If you selected `Your computer`, you will be shown a directory picker. If you already have Markdown notes open the directory containing them or create a new directory that Bangle will use to save your notes.

:bulb:_Pick a directory in a memorable location like Desktop, Documents etc._

:warning: _Don't forget to backup before opening your data. If you are in hurry simply copy and paste all your notes to another location to create a backup._

### Creating a note

There are two ways to create a new note:

- Execute the command `New note` in the Command Palette

- In an existing note create a backlink to the new note by typing`[[` followed by the name of your note and then clicking on the link to create it.

### Using inline palette

You can type `/` anywhere in your document or press `Command-/` (mac) `Ctrl-/` (win) to bring a handy toolbar for inserting things.

### Formatting text

Bangle expects users to use standard markdown shortcuts to format text.

- **bold** `Cmd+B`

- _italic_ `Cmd+I`

- For link `Cmd+K `or select text and paste link on it.

- \~~~strikethrough~~\~

- For image drag or paste it directly.

- ```` ``` ````for code block

- `` `inline code` ``

- `*` followed by space for bullet point or `Cmd-shift-8`

- `1.` follow by space for numbered list or `Cmd-shift-9`

- `[ ]` followed by space for todo list or `Cmd-shift-7`

You can also select the test to bring up the floating menu to making formatting changes.
